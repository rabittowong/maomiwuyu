## Overview

This project is an Angular-based web application designed for managing a game guild. The website serves as a central hub for guild-related activities, allowing visitors and guild members to interact with the guild in various ways.

## Features

1. **Guild Description**

   The website provides a detailed description of the purposes and goals of the guild. Visitors can learn about the guild's values, objectives, and the type of members the guild seeks to recruit.

2. **Guild Application Submission**
   
   Visitors interested in joining the guild can fill out and submit an application form. This form captures necessary details about the applicant, which the guild administrators can review for potential recruitment.
 
3. **Guild Announcements**
   
   Guild leaders can post important announcements and updates. These are displayed on the website for guild members and visitors to stay informed about the latest guild news and activities.
 
4. **Guild Events and Participant Lists**
   
   The application allows guild leaders to create and manage guild events. Members can view event details, and a list of participants for each event is displayed. This feature helps the guild coordinate activities and track member engagement.
